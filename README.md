# Nuclear Zombies (Name may change though I'm becoming fond of it)

Nuclear Zombies is a Gamemaker game developed by Fish_Eggs. The game was inspired by the idea to combine the gameplay and presentation of Nuclear Throne and Call of Duty Zombies, hence the current name. I'll try to update the game as consistently as I can but I cannot guarantee that it will ever be completed.

## Credits
My friends for helping out with the concepting and encouraging me to actually make the game<br>
Me for actually taking the initiative to make the game even if I never finish it.
