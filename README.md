# Nuclear Zombies (Name may change though I'm becoming fond of it)

Nuclear Zombies is a Gamemaker game developed by Fish_Eggs. The game was inspired by the idea to combine the gameplay and presentation of Nuclear Throne and Call of Duty Zombies, hence the current name. I'll try to update the game as consistently as I can but I cannot guarantee that it will ever be completed.

## Current Progress

Currently in kind of a rut with this game, realized that I have no idea how the game is going to play out which is kinda making me really unmotivated to work on this. Maybe making a Zombies mod for Nuclear Throne would've been a better idea to start with since most of the structure was already there. Wish I was good at concepting.

## Credits
My friends for helping out with the concepting and encouraging me to actually make the game<br>
Me for actually taking the initiative to make the game even if I never finish it.
