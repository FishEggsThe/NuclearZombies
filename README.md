# Nuclear Zombies (Name may change though I'm becoming fond of it)

Nuclear Zombies is a Gamemaker game developed by Fish_Eggs. The game was inspired by the idea to combine the gameplay and presentation of Nuclear Throne and Call of Duty Zombies, hence the current name. I'll try to update the game as consistently as I can but I cannot guarantee that it will ever be completed.

## Current Progress

Zombie pathfinding is at a point where I'm satisfied with it, but morework will need to be done to really polish it up, I'm also gonna start working up a map that'll function like an actual level you can play with perk machines and zombie spawns. I have no level design knowledge so I don't have much hope for it so idk. So yeah the plan now is to add new weapons, some perks, zombie spawns and point system with blockades to open like cod zombs. Might try to figure out how to make the weapon system better and less like Wasteland Kings game jam.
